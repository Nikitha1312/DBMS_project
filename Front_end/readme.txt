 2.Execute the start class using "java StartPage" which will open the start page window where the user is given a choice 
 to choose from the following:  
    1. Login:   
           On choosing this option,if the user is already a registered customer then he/she will login using login credentials
           and then it will be directed to the menu page where the user can choose the food items they wish to order and pay.
           In the menu page, we have an option called deposit which will direct the user to the deposit page where the user can
           deposit a certain amount to their account. When the user clicks the "paybalance" button in the menu page,the cost of the order 
           will be deducted from deposited amount.This eases the process of ordering as the user need not to enter the bank credentials everytime when
           they order.   
           If the user is a new customer they have to signup and enter their details to create their account.  
    2. Manager:   
           By selecting this option you will be directed to manager login page where manager enters his credentials. From there 
           he/she goes to "ManagerAccess page" where he/she can manage the order,delete the user and view the menu and ratings given by customers.  
    3. Surfer:   
           On choosing this button it will direct to "Retrieve Page" where user can view the dishes available on the menu and on entering the

    4. Review:   
           By selecting this button it will take us to the "Review Page" where the user has enter the foodname and gives review accordingly.
